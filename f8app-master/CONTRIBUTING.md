There are many ways to contribute to this project, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

* Go through the [Getting Started](http://makeitopen.com/docs/en/1-A1-local-setup.html) guide to insall and use the app. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app/issues).

* If you find an issue you would like to fix, add a comment stating your intent to tackle it. Then open a pull request with your changes. Issues tagged as [_good first issue_](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good place to get started.

## Pull Request Workflow

_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. A guide on how to fork a repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/f8app
